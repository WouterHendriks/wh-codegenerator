"Prezi Tips: 3 Shift key secrets",prezi-tips-3-shift-key-secrets,2015-07-03,,Yes,live,#76b9d2,#ffffff,"<p>Whenever you have used Prezi multiple times chances are high you have used Prezi shortcuts. But there are more shortcuts than Prezi gives away on their ‘Keyboard shortcuts’-page. In this article, we will reveal a few which all concern the Shift-key!<br>
</p><p>Let’s start of giving away the most obvious one, as it actually is mentioned on the Prezi website: Whenever you want to work pixel perfect, like a real Prezident, you will often find yourself using the arrows to place your selected content perfectly. By holding Shift, your content will move 10 pixels instead of one.
</p><p>Now you are really ready to know the 3 Prezi secrets of the Shift-key!
</p><h3>1. Making a selection</h3><p>While editing your next memorable presentation you might find yourself wanting to resize, replace, delete or duplicate multiple objects in your Prezi. There is a quicker way, than doing this one by one. Hold Shift and click and drag your mouse over the group of objects you want to select.</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/prezi-tips-shift-key.png""></p><h3>2. Adding and removing from your selection
</h3><p>You are now able to select a group of objects which are close to each other, but perhaps you do not need to select all of it. Just press and hold Shift and click on the objects you want to remove from your selection. And it works both ways!
</p><p>You can also add more objects to your selection, just by clicking them.</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/prezi-tips-shift-key2.png""></p><h3>3. Locating the group your object is in</h3><p>At Mr. Prezident we like to use Prezi to the fullest. That is the reason every now and then we find ourselves clicking an object which will not select because it is part of a much bigger group. Your now beloved Shift-key can do the trick! Just hold Shift and click the object, and Prezi will just bring you to the group. It is as easy as that!</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/prezi-tips-shift-key3.png""></p><hr><p>That is it for now, hopefully you will feel like a Prezident the next time you Shift your way through your next amazing Prezi!

"Icing on your cake",voice-is-icing-on-cake,2015-01-09,,Yes,live,#76b9d3,#ffffff,"<p>
	We're not the guys that refer to those good old days, but today is an exception. We want to take you back to the time when you didn't have Wi-Fi in your hotels and you were forced to watch whatever the TV was throwing at you. Being somewhere in France or Switzerland watching American films with French-voice overs, was entertaining. The example that springs to mind is Dances with Wolves. Kevin Costner speaking French, fluently of course, in a high-pitched voice is hilarious. We've seen the film in French dozens of times, but still don't get it.
</p><p>
	That teaches us a lesson, apart from the language barrier: The voice-over business is a risky business. A voice-over can make or break the message you want to put out there, and here's why.
</p><p>
	<b>1. Character</b>
</p><p>
	Choose the character of your voice wisely. What do you want your voice to represent? Is it authority, creativity, sensuality, a sense of mystery, energy?
	<br>
	Banks in general favor the elder white man with a deep voice, for a sense of authority. And the less authority they want to express, the younger the voice they choose. For the same reason supermarkets and retail chains favor the sort of chaotic housewife voice. That voice is an authority on spending household money wisely but has a touch of creativeness that women, and men, want to identify with.
</p><p>
	<b>2. Intonation</b>
</p><p>
	This usually goes wrong when a voice-actor does not know what he is trying to say. Putting emphasis on the wrong parts of your message can turn pretty nasty. The obvious mistake is a definition that is spoken as a question. Say goodbye to your authority. But we've seen worse. Sometimes what is told is the opposite of what is meant, just because of a way off intonation.
</p><p>
	<b>3. Timing is everything</b>
</p><p>
	This happens a lot if you work with pre-ordered voice-overs. It can be fixed, if you 're a kick ass editor with a talent for meddling with the spoken, but it is hard. If the energy of your visual message doesn't coincide with your audial message, people do take notice and forget what you were actually trying to say. So make sure that what is said, is said at the moment you want it to be said.
</p><p>
	<b>4. Conclusion</b>
</p><p>
	Was that it, is not how you want people to react after listening to your message. But this happens if your voice-over doesn't finish it off. It can be in the actual text, which is a completely different problem, but more often it is in the lack of energy shift in the last spoken sentence. We'll try to simplify our point, here. You want your voice-over to put some magic into the last sentence, so the audience will naturally understand it has come to an end. You can opt for building up extra energy or gradually slowing down. The how doesn't really matter, as long as it happens.
</p><p>
	But enough talking for now lets turn to a best case and a worst case. We've selected two great adventurous shorts, so you will enjoy the films even with a very poor voice-over.
</p><p>
	<b>Worst case</b>
</p><p>
	<b>Character:</b> not that bad, just lacking energy
</p><p>
	<b>Intonation:</b> non-existent
</p><p>
	<b>Timing:</b> not always spot on:

	<b>Best case</b>
</p><p>
	<b>Character: </b>Beautiful, mythical voice that suits the landscape
</p><p>
	<b>Intonation:</b> The voice leads you just like the waves do
</p><p>
	<b>Timing:</b> Its speeds up, slows down, it takes hold and never lets go
</p><p>
	<b>Conclusion:</b> It gradually slows down. So subtle, it is natural

	Last week Dutch comedian Bianca Krijgsman won an International Emmy Award for best performance by an actress. As it was her drama debut and her competition was extremely talented, Bianca did not expect to win. She did, and she had to come forward to address the audience. Totally unprepared, she delivered. Her speech was celebrated as energetic, funny and original. Perfect, or not?
</p><p>
	<iframe src=""http://media.zie.nl/e/?v=1n8zum0f4dkr&amp;sanoma_poster_url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zie.nl%2Fm%2F1n8zum0f4dkr_m.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""480"" allowfullscreen="""" style=""overflow: hidden !important;"">
	</iframe>
</p><p>
	<b>Only if unprepared<br>
	</b>Bianca walked on stage and pulled it off. But we have to take in account that she's an extremely talented comedian and that she's not afraid of making a fool of herself, and that helps when the world is watching you.
</p><p>
	In a night full of prewritten, uninspired thank-yous, Bianca's message was refreshing and energetic. Her enthusiasm and emotions were pure, contributing to the power of her talk. She had an important message to share, though. As the film was shot in an asylumseekercenter and the asylum seekers played as extras is the film, Bianca took a moment to express her hope, wishing that the extras will be given permanent residency status, so they can start rebuilding their lives. It was a wonderful message, straight from the heart, but it kind of faded away in her rattling and thinking of whom to thank.
</p><p>
	<b>Only if prepared<br>
	</b>If Bianca had prepared her speech, it would have lost some on-the-spot-originality, but being creative, she would have found ways to keep it original. The energy she took to the stage is hers, unprepared or prepared. Knowing whom to thank would have made her story coherent and less sloppy.
</p><p>
	These little things do point out that being prepared would have been better in her case, but let's turn to the single most important message in her speech; her hope for the asylum-seekers. It was, but it wasn't central in her story as it was just one of the things she listed. In a prewritten speech she would have been able to build up to this message and she would have been able to stress its importance. She could have expressed how the film changed the way she looked at the situation of asylum-seekers and she could have expressed her hope for the individuals she met while filming. Only if she had prepared her talk, people would remember the message, instead of '
	<i>Hi I'm Bianca from Holland. Woooooooow!.</i>
</p><p>
	<b>Duh!<br>
	</b>Our advice to you all is: Be prepared! Not really a life-changing lesson, right? We know, but let us rephrase: If you think you're talented, if you know exactly what you're talking about, if you think your charisma will do the trick, if you give pretty much the same speech on a regular basis, or if you are guilty of any other slightly arrogant reason not to prepare, remember, your single most important message will not remembered by your audience! Being hasty, looking for words, oh-yeah I forgot to mention, or any other minor slip-ups will downgrade the weight of your single most important message. And that's an opportunity wasted.

"The missing link",the-missing-link,2014-10-16,,Yes,live,#62a4be,#ffffff,"<p>We're not discussing cro magnons and neanderthals today, sorry about that. It is just that there's a link missing on your LinkedIn page, and as were at it, the LinkedIn page of your company is missing out too. Do you care? You should.</p><p>LinkedIn is wonderful, and useful but rather textual as well. And exactly that turned into a creative challenge for us. As visual storytellers, Prezi-experts and presentation professionals, we explore all possibilities out there. Not just for the fun of it, but also because we want to know the strengths of all tools available to us. And as it turns out Prezi and LinkedIn turn out to be a pretty good combination if you're trying to tell a story.</p><p>Let's embroider on this. Imagine you're a recruiter and you're responsible for attracting young talent. You have used the company's LinkedIn site to its full potential, or at least so you think. In only 500 words you've told how talent can grow, working for the company. Now imagine a talent looking for a job, landing on your particular page. He or she reads about 70 words, loses interest and surfs on.</p><p>Instead of just scribbling, try incorporating a standout Prezi on LinkedIn. Your site will be way more attractive with the visuals breaking the texts. The talent that you're looking for can consume all the worthy information in full creativity, instead of reading every detail in a summary. In this way it's easier to communicate your message and your target group will enjoy it more. Plus plus so far. And we didn't even mention the fact that your target group is out there, already making use of LinkedIn as the way to move their careers forward.</p><p>Ok, we have probably convinced you already. So there's no need to mention that it's pretty easy to embed a Prezi on LinkedIn, or that it's commercially way more viable to build or update a standout Prezi instead of a standout short film. But what might be useful to know is, that when you change or update a Prezi that's already been published, the link doesn't change. That saves you emailing the 400 colleagues that have already shared it on their own personal pages. We have built many a Prezi for our talent searching clients. They're happy clients now as they've improved their success rate on LinkedIn.</p><p>Let's turn to you now. What if you're not a recruiter? It actually doesn't matter. We could have told this story in a million ways. Imagine you're a talent, looking for a job, just create a magical Prezi and share it. Imagine you're a creative, just build a mind-blowing Prezi on your portfolio and incorporate it on your LinkedIn. We could go on and on all day.</p><p>We wish you all the luck in the world in creating a wonderful Prezi and in improving on your LinkedIn success rate. And if you need some help creating a standout, magical or mind-blowing Prezi, we happen to know just the talented guys that can help you with that.</p><p>Respectfully yours,</p><p>Mr. Prezident</p><p>Ps We get that you would like to see an incorporated Prezi on LinkedIn.

"Get the details right",get-details-right,2014-08-07,,Yes,live,#76b9d3,#ffffff,"<p>It is simply too easy to mess up a presentation. Every detail is a potential danger. All your efforts can be thwarted by a minor and very futile misstep. We have seen lots of details gone wrong over the years. It can be a beamer that doesn't work (should have checked it), or a slide that you forgot, a misspelled email address or phone number. It can be an unreadable font or it can be that you just did not prepare your presentation as you should have. Details can cost you dearly.</p><p>Details gone wrong can be funny (as our top 3 proves) and maybe you have the wit to correct your wrongs during your presentation. But we can only advise you to practice, practice and practice before you check, check and double check.</p><p><b>#3 The name game<br></b>We saw this misstep in a column in the economic section of a big Dutch national newspaper (de Volkskrant 31/06/2014). The writer, not exactly your new kid on the block, discusses the value of Google and Facebook. The new buy button that will side Facebook adds gives Facebook the advantage, for now, and Matt Zuckerberg will profit from it, according to the writer. Wait a minute. Did he just write <b>Matt</b> Zuckerberg? Yes he did. Oops!</p><p><b>#2 Online competition</b><br>With people spending less money on eating out, restaurants have to fight fiercely to survive. Competitors take this battle to the World Wide Web. We read a story about a restaurant that kept wondering why the crowds weren't coming on weekends anymore. Months passed by, until one customer asked why the restaurant was closed on the weekends. Weird question? Not really. It turned out a nearby competitor had stated on Google that this particular restaurant was closed during weekends, to draw the masses to his own place.</p><p>This is probably a criminal action, but it proves a point. In the public domain you're not always in control, so make sure you check information on you or your organization provided by other parties, from Google to the yellow pages and from blogs to news sites.</p><p><b>#1 Hang loose!<br></b>Summer is coming. Magazines and fashion labels want to sell cute dresses. To sell their items they show a lifestyle. A VW bus, a bright day, the sea and a beach make up the background. And of course a surfer accidentally walks by in the photo. It does seem very attractive, but something doesn't feel quite right.<br>In 80 out of a 100 beach ads that are to be found in these kinds of magazines, there are a couple of things missing.

"Content is king",content-is-king,2014-06-12,,Yes,live,#76b9d3,#ffffff,"<p>It is a common known fact, mentioned by professionals daily. Are you building a new website, a new app, a new whatever; is it SEO proof? Because content is king, remember.
</p><p>But is it really? When we stroll the web we see loads of s#it. Waste of time, waste of space. But if you follow these 4 golden rules, your content can be your king.
</p><p><strong>#1 Structure</strong><br>Did you ever walk into a library? What if all the books were on one big pile and the librarian is sitting there while your looking for that title that you need to have. Guess not. But guess what? On websites this happens all the time. Do you have an online catalog? Make sure all your individual files are named properly.When it comes to texts and especially texts that need to lure readers; make sure they are web proof. Short paragraphs and subtitles do the trick.
</p><p><strong>#2 Address the right people</strong><br>Nobody sends mail out and when they’re not sure the address is right. So why put content on your website when your not addressing your crowd in a proper way. Know your audience, know your customers and write technical, official, creative, abusive or whatever, if it suits them. Even if it doesn’t suit you.
</p><p><strong>#3 Stay up to date</strong><br>If your milk says best before march 2007, would you still drink it? Nobody would. Stupid question? Just as milk expires, commercial texts expire. Unless you’re Herman Melville, you’ll have to rewrite your texts. At least once every two years. Do not think that this rule does not apply to video. It does. Cutting and editing tricks that are cool today, can be lame tomorrow. Just like the word cool. While we’re at it, check your photographs and visuals too. Actually, rethink your whole website lay-out every couple of years.
</p><p><strong>#4 Be relevant or be nothing</strong><br>We love rules like this one, because you can always toss them into a conversation and they’re always right. But in this case it is really important. Make sure your content is worthwhile. If it’s not, dump it. People are looking for answers, want to be entertained or they are bored and happen to land on your homepage. Comfort them with the right content and they will return. Discomfort them with unnecessary, not even funny or just too much whatever and they’ll leave to never come back. Just bear that in mind.

"Multiple fade ins",multiple-fade-ins,2014-05-03,,Yes,live,#62a4be,#ffffff,"<p>Prezi enables you to ‘fade in’ images, videos or text in your presentation.
</p><p>The option to fade in is very useful, but can be difficult to use at the same time. One of the biggest challenges is multiple fade ins in one frame as you can only select the image on top. We wouldn’t be Mr.Prezident if we didn’t find a solution for this problem.
</p><p><strong>1. Choose your images </strong><br>Make sure they are the same size. In this example we are going to use squares with different colours.
</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/fade-in-step1.png""><br>
</p><p><strong>2. Put all images on top of each other</strong><br>Start with the image you want to show first and place the other images in the order you want on top. Select an image, right click on your mouse and choose ‘bring to front’. Do this for every image.
</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/fade-in-step2.png"">
</p><p><strong>3. Make a pyramid</strong><br>Select an image and use the minus (-) option. In this example we have 5 images, select the image on top, right click, click minus (-) 4 times. Select the second image and click minus (-) 3 times, for the third image you click 2 times and the fourth only 1 time. We leave the image on the bottom as it is.
</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/fade-in-step3.png"">
</p><p><strong>4. Fade in!</strong><br>Put your images in a frame and add it to your path. Press ‘edit path’ and use the little star which is next to the ‘path-step’, select ‘animate frame content’.
</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/fade-in-step4.png"">
</p><p><strong>5. Put them in the right order of appearance</strong><br>Select the biggest image first and work your way to the smallest one. Important is to select each image. When done, press ‘done’ twice.
</p><p><img src=""http://www.mrprezident.com/uploads/fade-in-step5.png"">
</p><p><strong>6. Final step</strong><br>At this point all images need to have the same size again. Start with the second biggest image, select it, right click and use the plus (+) option as much as you used the minus (-) option. Repeat for every image, working your way up!

"The effect of visuals",maximise-effect-of-visuals,2014-03-06,,Yes,live,#76b9d3,#ffffff,"<p>There once was a CEO of a billion dollar company. He kicked off his shareholders meeting with a beautiful photo, picturing a woman smelling a daffodil. It had been a bad year, but the daffodil lightened the moods of the shareholders. They all lived happily ever after.</p><p>This is not a true story of course. Shareholders do not want to see daffodils. They want to see growth and power symbols. And you should give it to them. So always make sure you know your audience and use visuals that tickle them. Not the ones that tickle you.</p><p><b>Only be creative when it’s asked<br></b>Do not try to be the creative guy when you have to give a presentation to scientists, businessmen or to people from a service oriented industry.
